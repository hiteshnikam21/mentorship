# 1. Introduction to *Cloud Computing*.

#### Cloud Computing is basically storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive and you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks.

#  2. Features of *Cloud Computing* .
#### Cloud Computing is perhaps the most useful technological innovation of the 21st century. This is because it has seen the fastest adoption into the mainstream than any other technology in the domain. This adoption has been fueled mainly by the ever-increasing number of smartphones and mobile devices that can access the internet. Cloud computing is not just for organizations and businesses it’s also useful for the average person as well. It enables us to run software programs without installing them on our computers it enables us to store and access our multimedia content via the internet, It enables us to develop and test programs without necessarily having servers and so on. Cloud computing is a 21st-century marvel that holds its importance in almost every field you can think of.

# 3.Introduction to github and benefits of using github.
#### GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. It hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. The service is able to do this by using git, a revision control system that runs in the command line interface.
#### Benefits of using Github:

•GitHub provides developers and researchers with a dynamic and collaborative environment, often referred to as a social coding platform, that supports peer review, commenting, and discussion.

•GitHub is a very versatile tool to use. It is ideal for working on projects of any size and it is an amazing tool for web workflows.

# 4.Basics of Markdown language .
#### Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. 

# 5.Importance of technical documentation .
#### Importance of technical documentation Documentation help ensure consent and expectations. Having reliable documentation is crucial in helping users figure out how to use a product as well as aiding writers and developers in creating work of consistent and high quality. Also if you are working on something currently and meanwhile you forget one or the other thing then you can always have a quick look at your documentation and recall evrything. Technical documentation is an asset for your organization, for the simple reason that it enables employees to access information without chasing their managers.

 > Features of **Github**
 - Repository.
 - Star.
- Watch.
- Forking.
-  Pull request and Merge.
 
 ### Repository:
- A repository is like a folder for your project.
- Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's history. 
- You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. 

### Star:
 - People can star other repositories as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repositories later.
### Watch:
 - You can watch a repository to receive notifications for new pull requests and changes that are created.
### Forking:
 - Forking is copying a repository from one user’s account to another. 
 - This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. 

### Pull request and Merge:
 - If you want to make any changes, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner of the repository.
 - That user can then, merge the changes in the original repository.

  ## 1. Disaster recovery in Cloud Computing.
  ## 2. Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx).
  
 # Disaster recovery in Cloud Computing:
 Cloud disaster recovery is a service that enables the backup and recovery of remote machines on a cloud-based platform.
Cloud disaster recovery (cloud DR) is a combination of strategies and services intended to back up data, applications and other resources to public cloud or dedicated service providers. When disaster occurs, the affected data, applications and other resources can be restored to the local data center or a cloud provider and resume normal operation for the enterprise.

#  Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx).

## Capital Expenditure(CapEx) :
CapEx is often used to undertake new projects or investments by the firm. Making capital expenditures on fixed assets can include everything from repairing a roof to building, to purchasing a piece of equipment, to building a brand new factory. This type of financial outlay is also made by companies to maintain or increase the scope of their operations.

##  Operational Expenditure(OpEx):
Operational expenditure consists of those expenses that a business incurs to run smoothly every single day. They are the costs that a business incurs while in the process of turning its inventory into an end product. Hence, depreciation of fixed assets that are used in the production process is considered OpEx expenditure. OpEx is also known as an operating expenditure, revenue expenditure or an operating expense.

## Cloud deployment models :
### Cloud deployment models indicate how the cloud services are made available to users. The four deployment models associated with cloud.
### It is a cloud-based infrastructure used by stand-alone organizations. It offers greater control over security. The data is backed up by a firewall and internally, and can be hosted internally or externally. Private clouds are perfect for organizations that have high-security requirements, high management demands, and availability requirements.

- ### Private Cloud
- ### Public Cloud
- ### Community Cloud
- ### Hybrid Cloud

##  Cloud Deployment Services :
- ###  IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- ###  PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- ###  SaaS (Software as a Service)

> Today I learn about AWS((Amazon Web Services):
# AWS (Amazon Web Services):
 
- ### AWS, a subordinate of Amazon, is a platform that offers comprehensive, on demand, secure cloud services to individuals and organizations to build, enhance and promote business applications.

- ### Amazon Web Services cloud provides an extensive package of very useful services which, when collaborate and work with each other, produce highly dynamic applications.
## Benefits of using AWS :
- ## Zero CapEx
Many people tend to believe that AWS or any other cloud-based solution are only for the riches. However, the reality is completely opposite. We see AWS as playing field leveler enabling start-ups to leverage high-end technologies and infrastructure needs with ZERO CapEx. 

- ## No-Commitment :
Whether you require a server for hosting a small website, a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for heavy traffic sites, reliable & scalable email service, data warehousing service,  or Hadoop cluster for your BigData needs, AWS offers everything with absolutely no-commitment at all, not even a month. All server-backed services are charged on hourly basis, so as soon as you terminate/stop a server, you won’t be billed from next hour.
 - ##  Get Rid of Negotiations :
 Surely price negotiations is not an expertise area for many (atleast me) and neither we like spending our time & energy doing that even if we have the skills. AWS is highly focused on reducing infrastructure cost for their customers.
 -  ## Procurement:
 Procuring a new server might take time between several hours to 8-10 days depending upon whether your infrastructure is on-premise, co-located or if you are associated with a hosting provider. Similar time is needed to procure software licenses as well. However, AWS enables you to spin-up new servers within few minutes with no need to buy separate licenses for many operating systems & softwares.
 - ## Pay Per Use
 Think of infinite space for your backup & archival needs, ability to launch new servers, up-scale or downscale a server, CDN integration, transcoding media files, unlimited bandwidth and many more highly scalable services or features available to you while you pay based on your actual usage only.
 - ##  Security:
 AWS has build world class, highly secure infrastructure, both physically and over the internet.
 - ## Flexibility:
 Forget about guess-work or scientific analysis to identify your infrastructure needs. You can leverage auto-scaling to build a self-managing infrastructure aligned closely to the actual need based on traffic/resources utilization. Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) enable you to spin-up clones in multiple regions for different environments within few minutes, eliminating the need to repeat the set-up steps every time.
 - ## Global Leader :
 Amazon has global presence with 10 regions, 36 availability zones and more than 50 edge locations. Few months ago, Gartner positioned AWS in Leaders Quadrant of the new Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service. Gartner also mentioned that AWS has more than five times the compute capacity in use than the aggregate total of rest 14 service providers placed in the same Magic Quadrant.
